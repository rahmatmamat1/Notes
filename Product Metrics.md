how do you define success for a product, and how do you measure it accurately? In the fast-paced world of consumer tech, these questions are more important than ever.

## 1. What is product success?

When it comes to defining success, you should focus on identifying a clear and measurable goal that aligns with your company’s mission. This goal should be:

> 1.  Specific
> 2.  Achievable
> 3.  Relevant to the product or service being offered
>    
> For example, a mobile app might define success as achieving a X number of daily active users within a Y time frame. Alternatively, a SaaS might define success as achieving a level of customer satisfaction or retention rate.

## 2. What are examples of success metrics?

Different companies will prioritize different metrics depending on their goals and business model. Here are some examples of success metrics that companies might use:

> 1.  **Customer acquisition**: The number of new customers acquired within a specific time period.
> 2.  **Customer retention**: The percentage of customers who continue to use a product or service over time.
> 3.  **Engagement**: The frequency and depth of user interactions with a product or service.
> 4.  **Revenue**: The amount of money generated from sales or other sources of income.
> 5.  **Net promoter score (NPS)**: A metric that measures customer loyalty and likelihood to recommend a product or service to others.
> 6.  **Lifetime value (LTV)**: The estimated value of a customer over the entire duration of their relationship with a company.
>
> By focusing on these and other key metrics, you can gain valuable insights into their performance and make data-driven decisions to drive long-term growth and success.

## 3. What are ways to measure it?

Once you defined your goal, the next step is to measure progress toward that goal. This can be done using a variety of tools and techniques starting with:

> 1.  **Quantitative insights** (Cohort retention, activation rate, etc)
> 2.  **Qualitative insights** (User feedback, testing, surveys, etc)
>
> **(Quantitative) By tracking user behavior and engagement**, you gain insights into how users are interacting with your product and where improvements can be made.
> **(Qualitative) Surveys and user testing** are also effective ways to measure success, as they provide direct feedback from users on what they like and dislike.
