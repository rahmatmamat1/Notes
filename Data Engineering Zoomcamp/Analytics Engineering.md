## What is Analytics Engineering?

Analytics Engineering is the process of designing, building, and maintaining the data pipelines and infrastructure necessary to support effective data analysis and decision making. It involves integrating various data sources, cleaning and transforming data into a usable format, and creating data models to support analysis and reporting.

## What is the differeneces between Analytics Engineering and Data Engineering?

Analytics engineering and data engineering are related fields that share some similarities but have some key differences.

Data engineering is focused on building and maintaining the infrastructure that enables data to be collected, stored, and processed efficiently. Data engineers design and develop data pipelines and storage solutions that can handle large volumes of data, often in real-time or near-real-time. They use tools like Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Hadoop, and SQL databases to create data pipelines and ensure data quality, reliability, and availability.

Analytics engineering, on the other hand, is focused on designing and building the infrastructure necessary to support effective data analysis and decision making. Analytics engineers use data pipelines created by data engineers to transform and aggregate data into formats that can be used by analysts and data scientists. They also design and develop data models that support analysis and reporting, using tools like SQL, Python, R, and business intelligence platforms.

In summary, while data engineering focuses on building and maintaining the infrastructure for data processing and storage, analytics engineering focuses on building the infrastructure necessary to support effective data analysis and decision making. Analytics engineering is more focused on the end-user and ensuring that the data is usable for business intelligence and decision-making purposes.
