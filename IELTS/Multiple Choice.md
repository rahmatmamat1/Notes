* it agrees with the information in the text - **TRUE (T)**
* it disagrees with it or contradicts it - **FALSE (F)**
* it is not mentioned in the text - **NOT GIVEN (NG)**

Here are the basic rules for the Identifying Information (True/False/Not Given) task:
- **The statements follow the order of information in the passage**.
- **The statements are not exactly the same as the wording of the passage**, but they contain the same information.
- **The statements include some words and names that are also used in the passage**. These help to locate the relevant information.
- You read this information carefully and compare it with the statement.
- You then decide if the statement reports the meaning of the passage exactly or not, and write TRUE or FALSE on the answer sheet.
- For some statements, there isn't enough information in the passage to know if the statement is correct or not. In this case, you write NOT GIVEN on the answer sheet.
