## Classification Evaluation Metrics
here are some commonly used classification metrics with explanations:

1. **Accuracy**: The accuracy metric is the proportion of correctly classified samples among all samples in the dataset. It is calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions made.$$Accuracy = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$$
	where $TP$ = true positives, $TN$ = true negatives, $FP$ = false positives, $FN$ = false negatives.

1. **Precision**: Precision is the proportion of true positives (correctly predicted positive samples) among all samples that are predicted as positive. It measures the ability of the classifier to avoid false positives. It is calculated by dividing the number of true positives by the sum of true positives and false positives.$$Precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$
3. **Recall** (Sensitivity): Recall is the proportion of true positives among all actual positive samples in the dataset. It measures the ability of the classifier to detect positive samples. It is calculated by dividing the number of true positives by the sum of true positives and false negatives.$$Recall = Sensitivity = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$
4. **F1 Score**: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It combines both precision and recall into a single metric.$$F1 Score = 2 \cdot \frac{Precision \cdot Recall}{Precision + Recall}$$
5. **ROC AUC**: The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a plot of the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings. AUC (Area Under the Curve) is the area under the ROC curve. It measures the ability of the classifier to distinguish between positive and negative samples. Higher AUC values indicate better classifier performance.$$ROC AUC = \int_{0}^{1} TPR(FPR^{-1}(t)) ,dt$$
	where $TPR$ = true positive rate (i.e., recall), $FPR$ = false positive rate.
	
7. **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix is a table that shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for a classifier. It provides a detailed breakdown of the classifier's performance.

9.  **Specificity**: Specificity is the proportion of true negatives among all actual negative samples in the dataset. It measures the ability of the classifier to detect negative samples. It is calculated by dividing the number of true negatives by the sum of true negatives and false positives.$$Specificity = \frac{TN}{TN + FP}$$
11.  **Cohen's Kappa**: Cohen's kappa is a measure of the agreement between two annotators or between an annotator and a classifier. It takes into account the possibility of agreement occurring by chance. It is calculated as (observed agreement - expected agreement) / (1 - expected agreement).$$\kappa = \frac{p_o - p_e}{1 - p_e}$$
	where $p_o$ = observed agreement, $p_e$ = expected agreement.

These metrics can help you evaluate the performance of your classification model and identify areas where it needs improvement.

## Questions

1. **When to use precision and recall?**

	The choice between precision and recall depends on the specific application and the goals of the classifier.
	**Precision is useful when the cost of false positives is high, and we want to minimize the number of false positives.** In other words, precision focuses on the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the classifier. Precision is commonly used in applications such as spam email filtering, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis, where false positives can have severe consequences.
	
	**Recall, on the other hand, is useful when the cost of false negatives is high, and we want to minimize the number of false negatives.** In other words, recall focuses on the completeness of the positive predictions made by the classifier. Recall is commonly used in applications such as information retrieval, where we want to retrieve all relevant documents from a database, even if this means retrieving some irrelevant documents as well.
	
	Here are some use cases for precision and recall:
	1. **Medical diagnosis**: In medical diagnosis, it is often more important to have high recall than high precision. This is because false negatives (i.e., missed diagnoses) can have severe consequences, and it is important to minimize the number of missed diagnoses.
	2. **Fraud detection**: In fraud detection, it is often more important to have high precision than high recall. This is because false positives (i.e., false alarms) can be costly and time-consuming to investigate, and it is important to minimize the number of false alarms.
	3. **Information retrieval**: In information retrieval, it is often more important to have high recall than high precision. This is because we want to retrieve as many relevant documents as possible, even if this means retrieving some irrelevant documents as well.
	
	Ultimately, the choice between precision and recall depends on the specific application and the goals of the classifier. It is important to consider the costs of false positives and false negatives in the context of the application, and choose the metric that best aligns with those costs.
