1.  Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): Bagging is an ensemble method that involves training multiple instances of the same model on different subsets of the training data, and then combining their predictions using averaging or voting.
    
2.  Boosting: Boosting is an ensemble method that involves training a sequence of weak models, where each model is trained to correct the errors of the previous model. AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting are two popular boosting algorithms.
    
3.  Stacking: Stacking is an ensemble method that involves training multiple models of different types, and then using a meta-model to combine their predictions.
    
4.  Blending: Blending is similar to stacking, but instead of using a meta-model, it involves training a weighted average of the predictions from multiple models.
    
5.  Random Forest: Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees, where each tree is trained on a different subset of the training data and a random subset of the features.
    
6.  Bayesian Model Averaging: Bayesian Model Averaging is an ensemble method that involves training multiple models with different hyperparameters or priors, and then combining their predictions using Bayesian inference.
    
7.  Rotation Forest: Rotation Forest is an ensemble method that involves rotating the features of the dataset and then training multiple decision trees on the rotated data, to reduce the correlation between the trees.
    

These are some of the most popular ensemble methods in machine learning, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and are commonly used to improve the performance and robustness of machine learning models.
